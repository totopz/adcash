You need to create a simple orders management app, which allows the user to:
1. Add, edit and delete orders
2. See a list of all orders
3. Filter orders from today, last 7 days and all time
4. Filter orders by user or product name
The data will be stored in MySQL database in these tables: order, product and user. You need to create appropriate structure.
Special business requirements:
- Discount of 20% must be applied to the total cost of any order when at least 3 items of "Pepsi Cola" are selected. (see the wireframe)
Requirements:
- You could implement whatever design you like as long as it has all of the described functionality and makes sense both from a UX and development standpoints
- You can use any HTML/JS/PHP framework
- Adhere to the PSR coding style
- Include relevant unit tests
- Upload the solution of the task in GitHub
- Provide a link to working demo app.
You do not have to follow this design, you can change it to whatever you see fit as long as it has all of the described functionality and makes sense both from a UX and development standpoints.
You can use any HTML/JS/PHP framework.
